# TTN Catalunya Data Analysis Environment

This repository contains training environment for workshops based around [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). The goal is to have an easy-to-deploy test enviroment for our workshops, and thus, it is not meant for production environment.

You can deploy the services using 3 different approaches:

* Using `docker compose up -d` from the docker folder to deploy a container stack
* Using `vagrant up` from the vagrant folder to deploy a VirtualBox machine
* Importing the OVA file from assets into your VirtualBox application

**I repeat: this project is not meant to be deployed in production environments**.

## Installation (outdated)

In order to run the project there are a number of steps you have to do. These are quite general steps when working with `git` and `docker` and we will try to go throu them. But if you have no background on `git` or `docker` we recommend you to take a look at these tutorials.

* [Docker Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
* [Docker Compose Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [GIT Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started)

The instructions below will asume you are working from the command line.

### Tested on

The project has been tested working on:

* Docker 18.06-1-ce, Docker Compose 1.23.2 on Linux Mint 18.3
* Docker 18.09-1, Docker Compose 1.23.2 on Debian 9.1
* Docker 18.09.0, Docker Compose 1.23.2 on Raspbian (see Raspberry Pi section below)

### Install docker

Installing `docker` can't be easier:

```
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

You might need to add your user to the docker group:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

And check it is working:

```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:2557e3c07ed1e38f26e389462d03ed943586f744621577a99efb77324b0fe535
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

```

### Install docker-compose

Install `docker-compose` for your platform by following the steps in https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Check you have it correctly installed:

```
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01
```

### Checkout the repo

Clone this repo to your computer:

```
$ sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/ttncat/ttncat-docker-compose.git
$ cd ttncat-docker-compose/docker
```

### Before running the project

Before running the docker-compose project please note it exposes a series of ports:

* Mosquitto on 1883
* InfluxDB on 8086
* Node-RED on 1880
* Grafana on 3000

If you have services running in your host on these ports the docker-compose will fail. You can either stop the services in your host or change the port these services in the containers are mapped editing the `docker-compose.yml` file. For instance, if you want the mosquitto instance in the container to be avaible on port 2883 (instead of default 1883) you just have to change the mosquitto service in the `docker-compose.yml` to this (notice the `port` section):

```
  mosquitto:
    container_name: ttncat_mosquitto
    build: ./mosquitto
    networks:
      - ttncat
    ports:
      - "2883:1883"
    volumes:
      - mosquitto_data:/mosquitto/data 
      - mosquitto_config:/mosquitto/config
      - mosquitto_log:/mosquitto/log
    restart: on-failure
```

### Run the project

Go to the working copy folder and bring up the services defined in the docker-compose project:

```

This will show the complete boot process for each container (the exact output will be different the first time it is run). You can also run them detached with:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Any of the two will create 4 docker containers (one for each service in Mosquitto, Node-RED, InfluxDB and Grafana, see them by typing 

```
$ docker ps

```

The will all share the same bridge network so they will be able to see each other using the service name as domain name (mosquitto, influxdb, nodered, grafana). It will also create several named volumes to persist the data on your host machine. You can check this volumes by typing 

```
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               ttncat-docker-compose_grafana
local               ttncat-docker-compose_influxdb
local               ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_config
local               ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_data
local               ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_log
local               ttncat-docker-compose_nodered
```

You can instect any of the volumes, for instance to know their location in your drive:

```
$ docker volume inspect ttncat-docker-compose_nodered
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2019-01-21T21:25:25+01:00",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {
            "com.docker.compose.project": "ttncat-docker-compose",
            "com.docker.compose.version": "1.23.2",
            "com.docker.compose.volume": "nodered"
        },
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/ttncat-docker-compose_nodered/_data",
        "Name": "ttncat-docker-compose_nodered",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

Once running you can stop the containers any moment with:

```
$ docker-compose stop
Stopping ttncat_mosquitto ... done
Stopping ttncat_grafana   ... done
Stopping ttncat_nodered   ... done
Stopping ttncat_influxdb  ... done

```

and start them again with 

```
$ docker-compose start
Starting mosquitto ... done
Starting nodered   ... done
Starting influxdb  ... done
Starting grafana   ... done
```

Both from the working copy root folder, where the `docker-composer.yml` file is. To remove the project from your drive bring it down (they must be first stopped): 

```
$ docker-compose down
Removing ttncat_mosquitto ... done
Removing ttncat_grafana   ... done
Removing ttncat_nodered   ... done
Removing ttncat_influxdb  ... done
Removing network ttncat-docker-compose_ttncat

```

and, if you also want to delete the persisted files: 

```
$ docker volume prune
WARNING! This will remove all local volumes not used by at least one container.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Volumes:
ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_log
ttncat-docker-compose_nodered
ttncat-docker-compose_influxdb
ttncat-docker-compose_grafana
ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_data
ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto_config

Total reclaimed space: 41.07MB

```

The project will also create a couple of custom images for Node-RED and Mosquitto you can remove them by 

```
$ docker image rm ttncat-docker-compose_nodered ttncat-docker-compose_mosquitto
Untagged: ttncat-docker-compose_nodered:latest

```

### Update the project

If the repository gets updated and you want to have the latest changes you can do it without losing any info in your persisted volumes. Only stop, pull the changes and start again the containers:

```
$ docker-compose stop
$ git pull
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage

### Mosquitto

Mosquitto will be listening on port 1883 of your host machine. You can use any MQTT client to connect to it. Using debian and `mosquitto-client` utilities is as simple as:

```
$ sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
$ mosquitto_sub -v -t /mytopic &
$ mosquitto_pub -t /mytopic -m hello
```

Mosquitto will create 3 volumes (mapped folders) in your host drive, one with the configuration, one with the retained data and a third one with the logs. 

### InfluxDB

IncluxDB will be listening on port 8086 of your host machine. You will probably want to create a database and maybe define some retention policies and continuous queries. Check the documentation for details but a first approach from debian would be:

```
$ sudo apt install influxdb-client
$ influx -precision "rfc3339"
Visit https://enterprise.influxdata.com to register for updates, InfluxDB server management, and monitoring.
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.3
InfluxDB shell 0.10.0
> create database ttncat
> [Ctrl+D]
```

### Node-RED

Node-RED will be listening on port 1880 of your host manchine. You can head over to the web interface by clicking here: http://localhost:1880. A number of additional nodes have been installed by default: `node-red-dashboard`, `node-red-contrib-blynk-ws`, `node-red-contrib-influxdb`, `node-red-contrib-schedex`, `node-red-contrib-telegrambot`, `node-red-contrib-timeout`, `node-red-contrib-ttn`, `node-red-contrib-yield` and `node-red-node-pushover`.

### Grafana

Grafana is also listening on port 3000 of your host machine, just click http://localhost:3000. The first time it will ask you for a user (`admin`) and password (`admin`) and immeditely will ask you to change the admin password.

## Raspberry Pi 3

### Install docker and docker-compose

The instructions to install them on a Raspbian are taken from these two sources:
* https://howchoo.com/g/nmrlzmq1ymn/how-to-install-docker-on-your-raspberry-pi
* https://withblue.ink/2017/12/31/yes-you-can-run-docker-on-raspbian.html

```
$ sudo su
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
$ apt update
$ apt install -y python python-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev
$ pip install docker-compose
$ exit
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
$ sudo reboot
```

### Running docker-compose

The file for the Rasberry Pi is different from the default one. To run `docker-compose` you have to manually define the file:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-rpi.yml up
```

From here on you can use the exact same commands as above to bring it up/down, start and stop them, with no need to specify the file again.

Please note this is a work in progress. My impression is that the docker-compose commands are too slow on the Raspberry Pi. Let me know your impressions.

## Special Workshop configuration

We have added a special configuration for workshops where you can use the `scale` option to create multiple instances on NodeRED and Grafana for your workshops. The `docker-compose-workshop.yml` configures up to 10 instances on Grafana (ports 3000 to 3009) and NodeRED (port 1880 to 1889). To avoid a clash with **Mosquitto** (originally on port 1883) this **has been moved to 2883**.

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-workshop.yml up -d --scale nodered=10 --scale grafana=10
Creating network "ttncat-docker-compose_ttncat" with the default driver
WARNING: The "nodered" service specifies a port on the host. If multiple containers for this service are created on a single host, the port will clash.

Notice docker does not enforce the ports for the instances, so if you are creating 2 nodered instances they can be ports 1884 and 1885, for instance. If you want to enforce them starting on 1880 you must restart the docker service first.

## Security

**This project is not meant to be deployed in production environments**.

That said, if you want to deploy the full stack on a public server, you should at least follow these steps:

1. Add an SSL reverse proxy upfront, something like [traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/), [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) will work. They will even manage the SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt for you (nginx will need an assistance service for this). You can dockerize all these solutions but maybe traefik is the easiest to implement when using a docker stack.
2. Secure your NodeRED installation using the [securing node-red guide](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red). You can access the container using `docker exec -it nodered bash`.
3. Secure your InfluxDB installation [enabling authorizations and creating users](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/authentication_and_authorization/). I recommend having an admin user, N users with write access to individual databases (one for nodered, one for telegraf,...) and 1 or many users with read access to the database to be used from Grafana. If you are using a multi-tenant approach (with organizations) then create at least one read-only user for each tenant with access to the databases she will need.
4. [Secure your Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/security/) installation with strong passwords and do not use the admin user for everything.
5. Use the SSL certs created by your proxy to secure your mosquitto if you want to leave it open to the wild. Create users for mosquitto.
6. Probably you won't need to map the InfluxDB port to the host (even less to the world) since all services are on the same docker network they can see each other using the name of the service to resolve the IP.

Some general rules:

* Keep your services up-to-date, there are docker-based solutions like [ouroboros](https://github.com/pyouroboros/ouroboros) or [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) that can do that for you but it's always better to do it manually and only when you are watching.
* Do not use the same password twice, keep them strong, use a vault with a password generator. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is the best option out there and you can selfhost it too.
* Do not expose ports you won't need (maybe you only need to expose grafana to the outside world).
* Evaluate if a VPN is good enough for you. The main advantage is that it is keyfile based, so only you will be able to access the server.
* If you are hosting them at home and you can create a separate VLAN for your server, do it. Prevent any intrussion to access your home devices.
* Never use a DMZ without a firewall on the server itself. Well, actually, never use a DMZ.
